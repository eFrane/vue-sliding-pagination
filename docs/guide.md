# Guide

## Usage

Basic usage of the pagination component only requires the current page,
the total number of pages and a handler which is called on page change.

The pagination component **does not handle page changes by itself**, instead
you are required to provide a page change handler which should contain
all your page changing logic (e.g. a vuex store dispatch) and eventually
change the current page to the passed one. In later releases, a v-model
approach to `currentPage` may be offered, but was opted against for the time
being.

Thus, to get a paginator with default settings (please consult the options listing
below for details), the following markup and script sections provide a starting
point:

```html
<sliding-pagination
  :current="currentPage"
  :total="totalPages"
  @page-change="pageChangeHandler"
></sliding-pagination>
```

```js
import SlidingPagination from 'vue-sliding-pagination'

// in component or vue instance
components: {
  // ...
  SlidingPagination
},
data() {
  return {
    // ...
    currentPage: 1,
    totalPages: 10
  }
},
methods: {
  // ...
  pageChangeHandler(selectedPage) {
    this.currentPage = selectedPage
  }
}
```

Additionally, the CSS for the component should be made available. Please refer to
the [Styles customization section](#styling) below

## Customization

The component offers severals customization options.

### ARIA labels

All ARIA labels can be altered and localized.

The labels `ariaGoToPageLabel` and `ariaCurrentPageLabel` support
the following template variables:

| Variable  |  Type  | Description               |
|-----------|:------:|---------------------------|
| `%total%` | Number | The total number of pages |
| `%page%`  | Number | The page under the cursor |

### Intervals

The number of pages shown on the beginning and ending of the pager
as well as the number of pages in the pagination window can be changed
dynamically. The break-point from normal to sliding-window pagination
can also be adjusted. **Please bear in mind that none of these intervals
and none of the calculations they are used in make any assertions on
obviously impossible configurations!**

_What are obviously impossible configurations?_

Glad you're asking! For one, the rule of thumb should be
`2 * slidingEndingSize + slidingWindowSize <= total`.
However, as there is a fallback coated as `nonSlidingSize` you can work around
this "limitation" with some ingenouity on your part. Basically, don't do stupid things
that disregards principles of natural numbers.

### Page navigation

The content of the previous and next page elements are customizable via the
slots `previous-page` and `next-page`. By default, these only contain
the "pretend arrows" aka &laquo; and &raquo;. The contents of these slots
are **only intended for visual use**. Screenreader users are presented
the `ariaPreviousPageLabel` and `ariaNextPageLabel` instead.

### Gaps

Depending on the current page, there may be a gap between the sliding window and the
beginning and ending pages. The gap content defaults to &hellip; but can be
customized **for visual use** under the same conditions as the page navigation with
the slots `gap-left` and `gap-right`.

### Page component

Since actual pages are the most active element of the whole pagination deal,
they have been implemented with the `<component :is="paginationComponent">` pattern.

The `SlidingPaginationDefaultPage` component offers guidance into how a basic
component representing page elements should look like. It's unit test can
be used as a basis for unit testing custom page components.

The page component receives the following props:

| name          |   type  | description                  |
|---------------|:-------:|------------------------------|
| ariaPageLabel | String  | The computed ARIA page label |
| isCurrent     | Boolean | Is the page the current page |
| page          | Number  | The page number to display   |

It is by no means required to implement all properties of the default page.
A custom pagination component can usually just be implemented as render
function, e.g.

```js
Vue.component('ExamplePageComponent', {
  props: {
    page: {
      type: Number,
      required: true
    }
  },

  render (h) {
    return h('a', { class: 'page-component' }, this.page)
  }
})
```

```html
<sliding-pagination
  ...
  pagination-component="example-page-component"
></sliding-pagination>
```

_Please keep in mind that the above example is absurdly simple for demonstration purposes
and breaks the ARIA compatibility of the whole pagination component._

### Styling

The CSS classes used in the component are following the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)-Methodology,
regarding **only** the component itself as a block and going downward from there, thus the
corresponding classes to interface elements are:

| Class                                         | Interface element                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .c-sliding-pagination                         | The whole component i.e. the `<nav>` container                   |
| .c-sliding-pagination__list                   | The `<ul>` containing all navigational and page elements         |
| .c-sliding-pagination__list-element           | Each `<li>` representing either a navigational or a page element |
| .c-sliding-pagination__list-element--active   | The `<li>` representing the current page                         |
| .c-sliding-pagination__list-element--disabled | Disabled navigational elements                                   |
| .c-sliding-pagination__page                   | The page element inside an `<li>` (typically an `<a>`)           |

To get the default styling, you may either add `dist/style/vue-sliding-pagination.css` as a
CSS asset to your page:

```css
@import "~vue-sliding-pagination/dist/style/vue-sliding-pagination.css";
```

For ease of customization, the original SCSS styling files are available in the distribution package
in the `dist/style` subdir, allowing quick and deep customization by utilizing the exposed variables
and re-declaring classes:

```scss
$sliding-pagination-background-primary: $background-primary;
$sliding-pagination-background-secondary: $background-secondary;
$sliding-pagination-foreground-primary: $color-foreground-primary;
$sliding-pagination-foreground-secondary: $color-foreground-secondary;

@import "~vue-sliding-pagination/dist/style/sliding-pagination";

.c-sliding-pagination {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 1.5em 0;
}
```

#### Class Map

If you need to adjust the class names inside the component, you can pass an object to reconfigure the `classMap`
used to determine any CSS class inside the component.

Here are the defaults:

<<< @/../src/defaultClassMap.json
